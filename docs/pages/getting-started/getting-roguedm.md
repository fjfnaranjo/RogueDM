\page getting-roguedm Getting RogueDM

Currently, RogueDM has no binary distributions whasoever. If you want to try
it you have to build it (see \ref building-roguedm).

Also, we are focusing our initial development efforts only on Linux support.
If you are using Windows or MacOC you may find difficult to build it (but you
should be able to do it).
