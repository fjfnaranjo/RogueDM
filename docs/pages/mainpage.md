\mainpage Welcome

**Welcome to RogueDM's documentation!**

RogueDM (Rogue Dungeon Master) is a [rogue-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)
inspired [virtual tabletop](http://rpgvirtualtabletop.wikidot.com/choosing-a-vt).
You can play role-playing games with your friends over the network and RogueDM
will take care of showing the action with its amazing text renderer.

RogueDM was also heavily inspired by [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/).

Finally, RogueDM is free (as in freedom) and licensed under the
[GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). Check the
Collaborators page if you want more information about helping
with RogueDM development.
